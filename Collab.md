#### Project Description
This project sought to work with a team to learn about a useful Digital Humanities tool. We chose to engage with a platform called Scalar created by the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture (ANVC). Scalar is an online scholarly publishing platform that allows users to upload files, text or other various forms of media. To test the tool, our team created our own page and published it with the program. It has very similar tools and functions to other digital publishing platforms, such as Wordpress. Our findings concluded that Scalar had no unique uses that set it apart from other such tools. It was simply built by, and for, content producers with a background in humanities.
