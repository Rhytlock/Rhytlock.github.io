## Bio

   My name is Jonathan Brenders. I am in my second year in Interactive Arts and Science at Brock University. Before taking this program at Brock, I had no specific research interest in the digital humanities. Research is an aspect of the program that does not appeal to my interests; instead I prefer to be working on creative projects. Interactive Arts and Science provides several different streams of learning to students, one of which includes a specialization in digital scholarship. In the future, I intend to pursue a career in 3D design or digital animation. There have been many projects I have worked on outside of the course that better represent these interests. 

   The following collaborative project, research presentation and academic blog were course assignments that I do not intend to expand upon. These projects have allowed me to expand upon my researcher’s skills. The collaborative project demonstrates an ability to work with a small team to conduct an effective research assignment. It shows an approach to collaborative scholarship. The research presentation was conducted without a team, emphasizing individual study. Finally, the academic blog, which is less of a blog and more so an academic essay. This paper relates a developed critical response to conducted research.

### Punched Cards and Tabulating Machines

<b>Abstract</b> Punched cards and their corresponding tabulating machines represent an often forgotten technology. Dating back hundreds of years, to around 1725, this technology was one of the earliest interpretations of the modern computer. This research presentation was conducted with the goal of excavating a piece of digital history. It explains why the technology was invented, several major uses and its presence in forms of digital media through the years. It also examines modern iterations of the technology. Punched cards were believed to be first used by Basile Bouchan, who developed a type of paper tape to control his loom. This tape was punched with holes, each of which represented one intruction. Two major figures that took to the technology were Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerlith. Babbage was a polymath; mamthematician, philosopher and engineer. He is credited with the original concept of a digtally programmable computer. Hollerlith created his own company around the technology, which later merged with three others to form IBM, a pioneer in the field of computing. Tabulation machines caught on slowly, the 1890 United States census was one of the first major uses for the machines. Families would complete punched cards, provided by Hollerlith, and then they were collected and counted. The process was a great improvement in efficiency over the 1880 census, which took three years to count. After this, the cards saw many uses, including census counts, inventory tracking, government checks and other accounting business. They also carry a black mark, being the technology which allowed Germany an accurate count of all the Jewish families in their 1933 census. The punched card and tabulation systems faded from popularity after the invention of magnetic tape. However, the system continues to see use today. Scantron systems and the punch cards uses by hourly employees are both modern iterations of the aged technology.

<b>Research Process</b> The research for this project was conducted online. The technology may be considered forgotten, but it still had a significant impact on the world at its peak. There are many records of punched cards and tabulating machines in use. Many of the people connected to this technology were also significant, Herman Hollerlith being the main example here. The project was created to focus on the production of a Pecha Kucha style presentation, or fifteen slides with an allotted twenty seconds each. Inspiration for the use of punched cards came after a long night of searching the web for pieces of “forgotten technologies” or “overlooked media”. I knew that I did not want to research something as recent as the Sony Walkman or Betamax. My understanding of punched cards at the outset of this project was very narrow; it never occurred to me that the cards themselves only represented half of this technology, with the other half given over to the tabulation machines that interpreted them. It had also surprised me to learn that the technology had been in existence since the eighteenth century. A final take away from this presentation might be that this particular Pecha Kucha format helps to develop the content of a presentation. With a clock constantly counting down in the back of one’s mind, the presenter might be more careful in the way that the content is structured.
