# IASC 2P02 | Jonathan Brenders

### Bio

   My name is Jonathan Brenders. I am in my second year in Interactive Arts and Science at Brock University. Before taking this program at Brock, I had no specific research interest in the digital humanities. Research is an aspect of the program that does not appeal to my interests; instead I prefer to be working on creative projects. Interactive Arts and Science provides several different streams of learning to students, one of which includes a specialization in digital scholarship. In the future, I intend to pursue a career in 3D design or digital animation. There have been many projects I have worked on outside of the course that better represent these interests.

   The following collaborative project, research presentation and academic blog were course assignments that I do not intend to expand upon. These projects have allowed me to expand upon my researcherâ€™s skills. The collaborative project demonstrates an ability to work with a small team to conduct an effective research assignment. It shows an approach to collaborative scholarship. The research presentation was conducted without a team, emphasizing individual study. Finally, the academic blog, which is less of a blog and more so an academic essay. This paper relates a developed critical response to conducted research.
